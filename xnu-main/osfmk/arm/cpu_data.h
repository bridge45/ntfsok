 * The "volatile" flavor of current_thread() is intended for use by
 * scheduler code which may need to update the thread pointer in the
 * course of a context switch.  Any call to current_thread() made
 * prior to the thread pointer update should be safe to optimize away
 * as it should be consistent with that thread's state to the extent
 * the compiler can reason about it.  Likewise, the context switch
 * path will eventually result in an arbitrary branch to the new
 * thread's pc, about which the compiler won't be able to reason.
 * Thus any compile-time optimization of current_thread() calls made
 * within the new thread should be safely encapsulated in its
 * register/stack state.  The volatile form therefore exists to cover
 * the window between the thread pointer update and the branch to
 * the new pc.
